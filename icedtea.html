    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What can be better than a tall glass of cold and refreshing tea during a hot summer day?
        This recipe of a home-made iced tea is incredibly easy and cheap, yet much fresher and
        more delicious than its alternatives from the store.
    </p>
    <p>The recipe is flexible and can be modified. You can add whatever you want, for example fruits,
        berries, more sugar, syrups, or even herbs!

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups filtered water</li>
            <li>6 bags black tea of choice</li>
            <li>1/3 cups of sugar, adjust to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>1 lemon sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh mint</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring half of the water to a boil in a saucepan.
                Remove from heat and add tea bags. Allow the tea bags
                to steep for 8-11 minutes (according to desired intensity).
            </li>
            <li>Remove the tea bags from the water. <strong>Note:</strong> If you prefer
            sweet tea, add the sugar while the water is still hot.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining water to the tea. Leave it refrigerated
                until chilled (about an hour).
            </li>
            <li>In a tall glass, add ice, lemon slices and fresh mint. Pour the chilled tea
                inside.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
