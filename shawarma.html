    <h1>Shawarma with chicken</h1>
    <img src="images/shawarma.jpg" style="width: 30%;">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious dish came from the Middle East and is extremely popular
        in the countries of Europe and Asia. It has everything you need: fresh
        vegetables, a thin-sliced juicy chicken, a tasty flatbread, and a lot of
        aromatic hand-made sauce.</p>
    <p>It can be made in a couple of minutes and is very addictive. Probably that's why this
        is one of the few
        meals that can be found in both fancy restaurants and fast food joints.</p>
